<div class="cell-0 val-content "><p class="BR" id="idWe-ve-all-received-it-at-times--Recently">We’ve all received it at times. Recently, I read an article on the WSJ about calling the next generation “entitled” as a sort of generational hazing that has to happen to get us to… work harder? I’m not really sure what it accomplishes.<br>
There seems to be two sort of modes for “Management Theory”. I put it in quotes because this is the bullshit Harvard is teaching business students these days. I started recognizing it thanks to our gracious President, Donald Trump. Who, if you have a problem with, is really just a reflection of your own problems and hatred towards yourself. I don’t care about how much you hate yourself, not in the context of this article at least.</p><h2 id="Management-1--Form--Storm--Perform--Norm">Management 1: Form, Storm, Perform, Norm</h2><p class="BR BR BR" id="idThese-are-the-slave-drivers--Middle-mana">These are the slave-drivers. Middle managers who think they are being productive my “putting the pressure on”. Hiring new employees, giving them more work than they can handle, measuring productivity, and laying off the ones that don’t meet their imaginary “status quo”; the “no-loads”. Read more about it here.<br>
I believe, this is what our President is doing. He is promoting people to positions they want, taking a small risk, and when they feel like they have aged 10 years in just 6 months, he sweeps his cabinet again. Cheerio.<br>
We are observing in our most high office the enactment of bad management advice. Isn’t it great? There is another principle that applies, especially to those like Alex Ocasio Cortes, is it called The Peter Principle (linked here). This basically states that a person will climb to the highest possible position on the corporate ladder until they are completely unqualified.<br>
Why wouldn’t the House of Reps prop up someone young and energetic? It is the way of the world right? The next generation has to step up and speak for themselves. She hasn’t lived long enough to be afraid of opening her loud mouth on every facet of society she doesn’t like. I’m willing to bet that AOC can’t even tell the difference between opinions and facts.</p><h2 id="Cure--Angels">Cure: Angels</h2><p class="BR BR" id="idI-m-not-talking-about-the-floating-figur">I’m not talking about the floating figures shrouded in glowing light; or babies with wings. I mean angel investors. People who are willing to spend their hard earned savings in order to see the world change. People who want to learn something about this world so badly they are willing to kiss it all goodbye.<br>
People, who have something figured out and want to share it. There aren’t enough angels in this world. Here’s the secret about productivity, and I hope this reaches someone who has been laid off, or hates their “corporate world” job. White-collar jobs aren’t productive. I read recently that tech workers are trying to form unions. The whole point of a union was to save people from dying of black-lung. You work in air-conditioning all day. As my father put it, “qwitchurbitchen”.<br>
You don’t actually make anything in a white-collar role. If you were making something, like a wooden train, you could measure how many wooden trains you are making and get paid accordingly. In a white-collar job, the produce of your efforts are entirely ephemeral. You can’t say for sure if you place 10 phone calls all of those people are going to sign up, or maybe they sign up one year and the next year they quit you because you care more about signing people up than actually building a quality product.</p><h2 id="Hanlon-s-razor">Hanlon’s razor</h2><p class="BR BR BR BR" id="idDon-t-attribute-to-malice-which-can-be-m">Don’t attribute to malice which can be more easily explained by stupidity.<br>
Like Joe Rogan said; “society has taken all the sharp edges off of life.” While this may not be true for genocide in the congo or warring over opium, or two societies bombing a village trying to sit peacefully between two mountains. In America it is definitely true. It is so easy to live in America, it’s even written in to our great nation’s history and law. Let me remind you of the second paragraph.<br>
[Every American has undeniable right to] “Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.”<br>
Easy to understand right? Not so. Our human nature has a habit of screwing this up, so let me spell it out. If you want to be miserable, you still have the right to live and be free. Life is sustained by physiological needs such as food, water, and air to breathe. Arguably, our generation is entitled to housing and free education, but that remains to be seen.<br>
Everyone in the world agrees we have it too easy, so we invent drama in our lives to screw up how easy we have it. Drama such as 50% divorce rates, spreading disease, not “taking care of ourselves”, arguing about money, arguing about politics, arguing about gender versus mental illness.</p><h2 id="Management-2--Manage-them-out">Management 2: Manage them out</h2><p class="BR BR" id="idI-have-to-write-about-this-because-it-ha">I have to write about this because it happened to me. This article titled “How to make an employee quit” pretty much sums it up nicely. Basically, during a “storming” phase, a manager piles on work until you get stressed enough that you make mistakes. Instead of appreciating all the great things a person can do, they focus on the 1 thing you did wrong.<br>
The manager gives you bad reviews, threatens to put you on probation. The worst thing they can do is lay you off because then the employer has to pay a tax penalty. Instead, they would rather incite “insubordination”; a legal reason to fire someone. Not that anyone in America could challenge being fired thanks to HRs little letter they send right after you leave saying that you won’t take them to court.<br>
Know how I know GlassDoor is bullshit? For that reason right there. If people left a company because of heinous actions and stood up for themselves in a courtroom, companies would be forced to treat humans with respect instead of like a disposable resource they are today. GlassDoor isn’t going to fix that.</p><h2 id="Cure--Reputation">Cure: Reputation</h2><p class="BR BR BR" id="idAll-of-these-bad-management-solutions-ar">All of these bad management solutions are commonly used today. All of them give companies bad reputations. This is why I will never work for a bank like Wells Fargo or a financial institution like Charles Schwab. I am so entitled that I don’t want to waste your time with my subpar quality of work. I am so entitled I care about your business saving money by not wasting it on me. Is that really entitlement?<br>
I have a bad attitude for American business. Maybe because I don’t know where money comes from. Or because over the last 10 years I have witnessed the American Ideal (that is, the best of the best) disappear. Things like, “money back guarantee”, don’t exist anymore. We’d rather not hear from customers at all than face the fact we’ve done something wrong. Or, the price of healthcare. No amount of insurance is going to fix greed.<br>
“Americans don’t know how to lose.” — Me<br>
This is one angry Republican reminding you to keep paying your taxes. Republicans hate it when I say that…</p></div>
