I present 1 piece of heresay and 1 piece of hard evidence. 1) I received my primary ballot after the date that it was due. 2) Below is an image I captured while trying check my voter registration status on Maricopa.gov website. This error has been around for about 2 decades. It is an internal ASP error, that should never occur in production. It should never be shown to the end user because most people won't understand what went wrong from this message. And, it should never happen because there should be good error checking. Clearly, someone working for Maricopa.gov does not have a mindset for quality assurance, and this would never have happened if they had contracted with me to build their website.</p><style>

Here is a server error from them while trying to check my card balance. Their website is extremely slow and absolute misery to navigate. It usually entails searching my Inbox for a secret token, attempting to log in, failing to log in, and then attempting to log in again and if any cookie crumbs get in the way during all this, the page fails to load. Not a good look for Google. I wish they would stop doing business with them entirely and find a new service. I finally was able to transfer the money off of the prepaid card by using my Square account to create an invoice for the total amount. Good riddance.</p><style>

Here are some pictures of a blowout we just had. Below the blowout is a picture of the tire pressure guage. It was low on the tire that blew out, so of course I went to check the pressure of the wheel that is indicated, the back passenger side wheel. The pressure was nominal so I thought it was a problem with the guage because I just filled all my tired evenly and within their limits. I continued my trip. Later, after the blowout, I had to put the donut on. Finally, a picture of the guage shows the back passenger tire, but you can clearly see from the picture the wheel that is at zero pressue is actually indicating the donut on the front passenger side. The tire guage is lying to me! They put my life in danger. I am pretty sure that the CEO of Chevy is not interested in fixing a design problem where a car mechanic can plug something in backwards, or however this happened.</p><style>

I recently closed my LinkedIn because I didn't find it useful anymore. But on my way out I of course came across some job postings. I started my application for SquareSpace. What an idea! Create an easy way for business builders to build their business online! I've tried to make builders before. When I was younger, I thought it was so novel to see the little drag and resize anchors in Powerpoint. I've tried to replicate that behavior, because Microsoft can't open source how they did. I was applying for SquareSpace and when I finished the application form, I got a lovely error "Application expired, please refresh the page and try again.". Wow. I hope they don't treat their customers this poorly. Personally, I would never tell someone to refresh the page and start from scratch. That reflects very badly on a company that is supposed to pride itself on good design.</p><style>

But, how can someone ever become humble if they aren't humiliated? Here is another one from Greenhouse.io. You don't want to manage hiring people, so you outsource it to another company that screws up at hiring people? Enter, ADP. I've written about another negative experience with ADP. Where I had a call with someone who asked me "what job site did you apply through?" Just to lie and gaslight me in to questioning my own reliability and make me look like a liar. ADP sucks and is completely immemorable. All those employees and engineers being paid by business' account fees and they can't even test their product on a mobile phone.</p><style>

When I started realizing something strange was happening, I got in the habit of taking screen shots of it. I'll post the screen shots here so, hopefully, someday in the future someone can look back and see the evidence of complete chaos.</p><style>
#id-Screenshot-20180910-173105-png:before {background-image: url("/Screenshot_20180910-173105-final.jpg");}</style><p class="IMG" id="id-Screenshot-20180910-173105-png"><img src="/Screenshot_20180910-173105-final.jpg" alt="GDPR woes"></p><p class="" id="idThe-image-above-is-a-picture-of-a-CSS-z-">The image above is a picture of a CSS z-index error. The message was intended to be on top of the menu for users to accept, it shows up behind giving the page a weird look. The image below was pretty annoying. I was using Square to set up an invoice and it let me complete everything and submit the Invoice until the next screen where it said it failed. I realized I had to go back and select a specific date to the send the Invoive because their default option of "Send Immediately" was broken and couldn't validate. Telling me which field cause the validation to fail would have been nice!</p><style>

It also happens with LinkedIn's identitify verification and causes a bad experience. When I take a picture with today's modern phone cameras, most of those images are larger than 2MB. So instead of converting the image client side and uploading it, they block the upload entirely. This happens because nobody tested it was working.</p><style>

Some things have begun working extremely well, and I barely noticed. The DMV (department of motor vehicles) doesn't take hours for simple tasks, you can actually get things done in 20 minutes or less now. Amazon takes returns from UPS, that's incredible that they would choose another company in order to offer pickup locations. Courthouses have libraries and printing services inside of them now. Businesses suddenly started bringing credit card machines to the customer instead of taking their card away. like they've done in Europe for years to prevent identity theft.</p><p class="" id="idThis-is-an-error-on-one-of-the-screens-a">This is an error on one of the screens at Whole Foods.</p><style>

They have so many employees, they should be able to check each other's work.</p><style>

For example, a graphic user interface (GUI) that simply works really well.  Or, complaining about how ridiculous Microsoft's design is and how much better I could have done if I had written it.
