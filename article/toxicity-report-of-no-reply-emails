<div class="cell-0 val-content "><p class="" id="idI-like-to-think-that-in-happiness-and-mi">I like to think that in happiness and misery, I am not alone. There must be someone out there in the world that agrees with my “opinions”.</p><p class="BR" id="idUsually-when-I-have-an--opinion---the-pe">Usually when I have an “opinion”, the people at the receiving end don’t know, or care about the amount of time and research I’ve put in to developing an “opinion”. So much effort, that I seem to construe my ideas as scientific fact.<br>
I’ll share some research on no-reply email addresses with the world, and maybe someday it will be appreciated.</p><h2 id="What-is-a--no-reply--email-">What is a “no-reply” email?</h2><p class="BR BR BR" id="idIn-marketing--a-no-reply-email-is-a-part">In marketing, a no-reply email is a part of an Advertising Campaign. Someone in an office designed an email to sell you a product, or an automatic response to an inquiry a customer has made about a business.<br>
Every time you click “Contact Us”, or apply for a job, or even order a product. The customer is shortly greeted with a response, similar to “We have received your request and will get back to you shortly” or “Your order is being processed and will be shipped soon.”<br>
This may seem pleasant at first, but if you look at who sent the email, it usually says “no-reply@arogant.biz” Why is this?<br>
A no-reply email is sent by a remote machine, and the sender, or original configurator doesn’t want a response. However, sometimes I do respond. Here is less than fascinating part of my research. Some no-reply email addresses actually send a reply. The reply usually consists of “This is an invalid email address, and no one will see your message.” I get this from Amazon! The largest online retailer in the world sends a response from their no-reply emails. I especially hate this response when it comes to dealing with support.</p><h2 id="Why-is-no-reply-bad-for-business-">Why is no-reply bad for business?</h2><p class="BR BR" id="idI-have-started-multiple-businesses--Over">I have started multiple businesses. Over the years, I’ve never considered using a no-reply email address. Instead, I send all emails and marketing communications from, for example, admin@honorable.biz. This is a virtual email address set up to copy to brian@honorable.biz and ceo@honorable.biz, or whoever else the email might be relevant to.<br>
I manually check every business inquiry. Kind of like jeff@amazon.com, but lately I haven’t been getting replies. Since his divorce, I think he doesn’t want to hear it anymore and blocks all non-work-related emails.<br>
There are, however, legitimate reasons why a person would want to reply to an expectedly one-way-communication. For example, if a person doesn’t know how to unsubscribe, they might respond “please unsubscribe me”. Instead of hitting the “Report Spam” button and tarnishing your reputation because of errors in unwanted communication.</p><h2 id="What-is-a-solution-">What is a solution?</h2><p class="BR BR" id="idYears-ago-while-setting-up-Postfix-on-Li">Years ago while setting up Postfix on Linux, I realized I can filter all incoming messages on my mail server to run through a series of scripts. I could reorganize emails server-side, instead of client-side like Outlook rules. I had dozens of email addresses set up for every service and website I ever signed up for. I put all my emails in their own folders so that I WAS IN CONTROL. Instead of being blasted constantly by marketing emails, I could seek out the information I want, WHEN I WANT TO.<br>
No more did I get an email notification at 2 AM in the morning because someone from another timezone decided to blast thousands of customers. Why is this even a thing?<br>
Change your email address in marketing emails from no-reply@arogant.biz to support@honorable.biz.</p><h2 id="My-opinion-sprinkled-with-truth-salt">My opinion sprinkled with truth salt</h2><p class="BR BR BR BR BR" id="idBusinesses-who-claim-to-care-about-their">Businesses who claim to care about their customers actually don’t; they only care about money.<br>
If companies could, they would send someone to your home to shout in your face at 2 AM in the middle of the night.<br>
Companies don’t have time or care about feedback or criticisms.<br>
The Marketing department and the Support department are incapable of communicating with each other.<br>
This pretty much sums up American businesses. Some people detest using traffic stops to fight crime. I detest Tech companies acting like wizards behind the curtain; using it as a veil of perfection.<br>
I hope this changes, because until it does, I enjoy forcing your support team to share my misery. Maybe I am just nit-picking.</p></div>
