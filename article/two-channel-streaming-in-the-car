<div class="cell-0 val-content "><p class="" id="idSome-of-us-can-t-afford-an-iPhone-and-AT">Some of us can’t afford an iPhone and AT&amp;T’s overpriced and unreliable service plan.  I have an alternative.  Most networks offer some kind of internet plan, Verizon for example is only an extra $30 per month, no matter what plan type you have.  Alltel also offers an all in one package.  Here I will discuss an alternative to using Pandora on an iPhone.</p><h2 id="The-Phone">The Phone</h2><p class="" id="idI-am-using-a-Treo-700WX-for-this-example">I am using a Treo 700WX for this example.  One of its many features is 2-channel audio output.  Stereo jacks are separated into different segments.  On most stereo jacks there is a tip, a middle segment, and a ground.  On the standard stereo jack the left channel is the tip, and then right channel is the middle segment.  On cell phone jacks, it is usually a mini-stereo jack where the tip is left channel, and the middle segment is microphone.</p><p class="" id="idThe-Treo-however-supports-2-channel-audi">The Treo however supports 2 channel audio; so the jack has 4 segments.  The tip is then the right channel, the first segment after that is the left channel, then the microphone, and then ground.  So if a 3 segment jack that is not made for the Treo is used, the microphone still uses the right segment.</p><p class="" id="idWith-the-Treo-s-unlimited-data-plan-I-ca">With the Treo’s unlimited data plan I can stream music from my server using TCPMP.  But I still need a way to connect the phone to the car stereo.  This task would have been greatly simplified if I had a stereo with an auxiliary input.</p><h2 id="The-Stereo">The Stereo</h2><p class="" id="idThe-stereo-is-stock-equipment---It-has-a">The stereo is stock equipment.  It has a CD player and a tape deck.  Fortunately I had a stereo jack to tape converter lying around.  The first modification I made was I removed the mysterious locking device inside the tape converter.  There are a series of gears that if turned at a different speed will lock in to place.  This was preventing the stereo from using the tape converter properly, and after I removed it, it worked perfectly.</p><p class="" id="idI-then-unsoldered-the-3-mounting-points-">I then unsoldered the 3 mounting points for the standard stereo jack, and soldered on the wire from the ear-buds for my phone.  The hard part was actually getting the wire from the phone jack attached to the solder; the wire is very small and is encased is a metallic-looking casing that makes it difficult to tell if it the wire in the middle is actually making contact.  I recommend attaching it at an angle from straight above the devices to increase the likelihood of it making contact.  Also, using a multi-meter is always a good idea.</p><h2 id="The-Stream">The Stream</h2><p class="" id="idVideo-over-LAN-Media-Player--VLC--is-ver">Video over LAN Media Player (VLC) is very useful when setting up a stream-able connection.  It can trans-code any type of audio and output any bit-rate in any format.  So, I used an mmsh-asfh stream, which is generally compatible with windows media player.  I can load a playlist file and add the --loop option to make the playlist keep repeating.  There are many other options, for example making the playlist play in random order.  I can then connect to that on my phone using TCPMP.</p><p class="" id="idFinally-I-have-2-channel-stereo-audio-st">Finally I have 2-channel stereo audio streaming wherever I go in my car.</p></div>
