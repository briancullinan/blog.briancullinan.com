This will be fun. When Donald Trump became President of the greatest country in the world, I realized two realities have diverged. In Forwards World, time remains the same, constantly moving in one forward direction. The society rewards harmony and kindness around every corner. Suffering and hunger is declining. War has nearly ended. Technology companies build up society instead of tearing it down in the name of profit.
In Backwards World, however, the conditions are quite different. Families split up constantly, divorce, broken promises. The President says the most egregious things and people praise him for it. War is rampant. Homelessness, hunger, and mental illness are everywhere. Doctors care more about your insurance plan and getting paid, instead of overall body health. Time travels backwards. Things we think we ought to have known aren’t learned until after we ought to have known them.
Living on the edge
It was around the beginning of Trump’s presidency when Elon Musk thought our reality only exists inside a computer simulation. I realized, perhaps this computer simulation can be hacked.
I intended to exist in both realities, with a hard line in between. In everyday, face-to-face life I would be the kind hearted, warm, loving, serving person I had always intended. For this world, is one where everyone’s ethics and personal philosophies are publicly up for debate.
Online, I would be completely offensive. Like a troll, but where people at the other end of my trolling would be unable “correct” my shameless behavior. My targets for attack weren’t usually personal, or at least if they were personal, the intent would be positive. My targets would be companies, tell them everything I saw that is wrong with them. Kind of like Jim Carrey crossed with our President Donald Trump.
Developing a process for philosophical correctness
I would use my entire life’s path, recording and documenting all seemingly meaningful events in my life. By the time I reach the end of my life, I will have enough data and events to prove which parts of my life were correct and happened because they should, and which events are unnecessary and should have been avoided.
I had studied Religions of the World in college, and realized that all religions have at least a few things in common. They all shared goals that are meant to withstand the test of time. Since Backwards World and Forwards World have different temporals, the underlying philosophy should still be consistent between the two realities.
Religious philosophy seems to share goals such as health, happiness, and prosperity. My own personal philosophy would need to indicate that as well. I convicted to only living by philosophy taught to me by others, people who I respect. I would repeat the things smarter people say to me, I would base every action on a lesson I had learned previously. Be the “product of my surrounding” in an age where consumers are the product. The only people believe in me, are the ones closest to me.
If I was attacked personally, I would attack back.
Small talk must be avoided at all costs
In both realities, I avoid small talk. I never liked it. I don’t ask people, “how are you doing?” I just assume if they are healthy enough to speak to me, they must be doing fine (fearful, insecure, neurotic, and emotional). I don’t care for small talk because no one ever gives honest answers. “Do you like the rain?”, “Of course, especially when it hides my tears.” No one ever answers the question, “How’s the weather?” in that manner. So what is the point?
I check in with friends the moment they pop in to my head
While this sounds like a lovely sentiment for Forwards World, in Backwards World I am constant burden on people I love. A simple question like, “living the dream?” or “are you healthy?” becomes this incredible weight on my targets shoulders. Most of the time, I’m completely ignored and never get a response.
It isn’t just me though. Relationships in Backwards World are continuing to become less and less personal. The platforms we use suggest generic responses like “Happy birthday!” or “Congratulations!”. All I have to do is go through the list and click “Send”! It couldn’t be easier to send an impersonal, useless communication that takes very little thought or effort in Backwards World.
Honesty and integrity aren’t virtues in Backwards World
I have learned that being honest about my goals, which are always slightly outside of my capabilities, is completely unnecessary. Not only do people in Backwards World not care about my goals, if I am honest with a company about them, I am shunned and accused of being distracted/distracting to others.
In Backwards World, if you hold a personal conversation at work, you are the problem. Work is about “getting things done”, and not about the people involved. Every job is a “pie in the sky.” People manipulate each other to try and motivate them, but it has the opposite effect.
The Wizard of Oz will NEVER show you what’s behind the curtain, even though we all (in Forwards World) deserve to see it.
Money is king, not your love
Because Dido came out before the Trump Presidency, her sentiment should exist in both realities. In Forwards World, your love is king. It is the driving force behind ALL motivation. Love for the game of life, love for your career and job, love for every single person you’ve ever crossed paths with.
I express this love, to all of my targets. I can’t tell if a person is living in Backwards or Forwards world until I see them change direction. In Backwards World, I can only express love after someone has done me wrong. In Forwards World, I am filled with love by every person I talk to, and life seems and appears to be normal, stable, and joyful.
In Backwards World however, money is king. Money is the greatest king we’ve ever had. Money, can be used against you at any time. Money can be used to hire a lawyer to sue a doctor who was just doing their job after 40 years and plenty of critical acclaim. Money is sought after ruthlessly by companies. They are willing to lie, cheat, and steal just to make a quick buck. Money is used to hurt people.
If you can’t pay court fees, you can be sent to prison (which is an abhorrent abuse of the judicial and executive system working against you). If you can’t pay bills, you lose your car, house, and worst of all, your health. If you lose your job, or your career is caught between two realities, a court order can be used to ruin your life. Philosophically, this is what God means by “the lesson you learn from losing”, much like Job (j-O-b). Funny, it sounds like job, like the thing you get just to keep your life in order.
It isn’t fun anymore, let’s turn around

It isn’t fun anymore, let’s turn around
While this may seem like a fun mental exercise, it isn’t fun to live caught between these two realities. I’ve been assaulted, my well-being put on the line. Online-bullying appears to be rampant, but there is no way to stop it or prove it. I’ve seen a person with a police badge in their profile, if they aren’t really an officer, isn’t this illegal (impersonating an officer)? How do you know if the person you are talking to is an alternate profile they set up to avoid their parents noseyness, or someone trying to steal your identity? When someone asks for the last 4 digits of your social security for a job interview, how do I know they aren’t entering it into my bank to gain access to my account?
In Backwards World, I receive mail that looks like checks. I get phone calls telling me I am being Federally investigated. Passive-aggressive employers ask me what I am an “expert” in, knowing full well, I don’t have the confidence to claim any expertise in anything, really.
The American Ideal is DEAD! Values taught to me by my European wife, such as “money back guarantee,” are no longer American Ideals. When someone rich commits a crime, they go free. When someone poor commits a crime, they go to prison. False advertising is everywhere, but no one can ever prove or stop it from happening. In Backwards World, Tesla Solar charges more money than they save you, APS, Comcast, TelCel are all government supported monopolies who don’t care about their customers.
The best part of Backwards World is Donatos Pizza is finally spread across the US, featured at Red Robin. Being from Ohio, I never thought it would happen. I have missed the crispy edge-to-edge pepperoni and toppings with a crispy thin crust and corn flour bottom. If this happened in Forwards World also, perhaps the two realities have started to reconverge! Let’s turn this ship around, matey!
