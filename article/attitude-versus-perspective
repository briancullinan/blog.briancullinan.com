<div class="cell-0 val-content "><p class="" id="idI-get-this-a-lot--you-need-an-attitude-c">I get this a lot “you need an attitude change.” Let’s talk about the difference between a bad attitude and a bad perspective.</p><p class="EM" id="idI-ve-read-tons-of-philosophy--and-one-ph">I’ve read tons of philosophy, and one phrase that really sticks out to me is the idea of “unwarranted or unsolicited advice.” Now, we could easily chalk it up to human nature that when we see an animal or fellow human suffering we try to help ease that pain. It is probably also human nature to try to help by not actually helping. Hence, telling someone they need an attitude change doesn’t really <em>help</em> the person.</p><p class="STRONG" id="idTelling-someone-you-don-t-like-their-att">Telling someone you don’t like their attitude is like telling someone they should see a doctor. Let’s break this down. Philosophically speaking, we “try to remove all negativity” from our lives. Jesus, on the other hand, tells us to go toward and help the sick, no to avoid it all together. I have a theory the act of trying to avoid negativity actually creates <strong>more</strong> negativity in the world, even if we don’t have to see it.</p><p class="" id="idSo-on-a-philosophical-level--by-telling-">So on a philosophical level, by telling someone “you need to see a doctor” is the same as saying, “go find your own Jesus”. Obviously, no one would ever reasonably expect to find Jesus’ on their own. Just like the blind man wasn’t expecting Jesus to just show up and cure his eyesight, aka perspective.</p><p class="BR" id="idLet-s-act-out-a-few-scenarios-that-I-hav">Let’s act out a few scenarios that I have in my head, so the disconnect can be better understood.<br>
Abe is looking for a job, and Jack has a lot of connections who might be hiring.</p><pre><code>Abe: I’m looking for a job.
Jack: Have you tried applying for freelance.
</code></pre><p class="" id="idIn-this-scenario--Jack-has-no-interest-i">In this scenario, Jack has no interest in actually helping Abe.</p><pre><code>Abe: I’m looking for a job, I know React, but there’s a lot of better technologies out there.
Jack: I know people hiring for React, I’m sure you’ll find something.
</code></pre><p class="" id="idAgain--in-this-scenario--Jack-has-no-int">Again, in this scenario, Jack has no interest in helping Abe find a job.</p><pre><code>Abe: I would like to work for a company using React.
Jack: Great! Apply here and next time I talk to the hiring manager, I’ll mention your name.
</code></pre><p class="EM STRONG" id="idFinally--Jack-has-actually-helped-Abe-wi">Finally, Jack has actually helped Abe with the application process. The key component here is Jack’s investment in the advice and <em>help</em> he is giving. Rather than Jack thinking that he is helping by giving frivolous advice, Jack did the <strong>action</strong> of actually helping by telling Abe where to apply, and mentioning his application to the hiring manager. Jack is using whatever clout and reputation to help Abe, and therefore when Abe fucks up, it makes Jack look bad. Why would Jack ever go out on a limb to help Abe, even if they were friends? It just isn’t worth the risk.</p><p class="" id="idWe-can-do-the-same-mental-gymnastics-wit">We can do the same mental gymnastics with medicine.</p><pre><code>Abe: I think I need to see a doctor.
Jack: I’m sure there are doctors in your area you can talk to.
</code></pre><p class="" id="idJack-is-very-standoffish--maybe-he-cares">Jack is very standoffish, maybe he cares about Abe’s problem, maybe he doesn’t.</p><pre><code>Abe: I think I should talk to someone.
Jack: You just need an attitude change.
</code></pre><p class="" id="idJack-clearly-does-not-understand-the-nua">Jack clearly does not understand the nuanced difference between attitude and perspective.</p><pre><code>Abe: Do you know any good doctors?
Jack: Yes, I go to Dr Chase. He really helped me with my depression.
</code></pre><p class="" id="idJack-is-finally-making-an-effort--He-jus">Jack is finally making an effort. He just performed the action of a “reliable referral”. Now, if Abe starts taking antidepressants and decides to kill himself, Jack is going to feel partially responsible. That sucks for Jack, it would be easier for him to stay guarded and standoffish so he never has to commit to a real friendship.</p><p class="STRONG" id="idThe-problem-with-these-scenarios-is-Abe-">The problem with these scenarios is Abe and Jack have different perspectives. The <strong>attitude</strong> is completely irrelevant. Attitude can change based on perspective. For example, if Jack and Abe are both unemployed that could express different attitudes but their perspectives would be the same. Or in the case of needing a doctor, both of them might have the perspective that finding a good doctor for a specific ailment is difficult and time consuming. It might even be costly if you are trying to find a doctor for your depression and it turns out to be dietary related, the doctor might just refer you somewhere else but charge $300+ for the consultation, just to refer you somewhere else.</p><p class="STRONG STRONG" id="idIn-the-scenario-of-Jack-helping-Abe-find">In the scenario of Jack helping Abe find a doctor, Jack might have saved Abe $300+ for a consult just by directing them to someone reliable. Unfortunately, these situations arise all the time. But instead of dealing with Abe and Jack, it could be a contractor, or even somebody with health insurance trying to find health care <strong>In</strong> versus <strong>Out</strong> of the network. If it’s a small town there could be a limited number of professionals available. Maybe the medical center just rebranded and Jack went to their new office under new ownership and Abe doesn’t know where to look.</p><p class="" id="idThe-important-thing-here-is--realizing-t">The important thing here is, realizing the difference between telling someone advice, and actually doing something to help them. The first one is unwarranted, the second one takes a lot of care and consideration. If you aren’t willing to put in the care and consideration to actually help someone in need, giving them advice to help themselves isn’t going to help either. It will just come off as disingenuous and thoughtless.</p><p class="" id="idI-remember-one-time-coming-out-of-the-in">I remember one time coming out of the interview, some underling looking for a come-up insisted that I “must watch Uncle Bob Martin.” Now what would be the point of that? This is a lot like a recruiter saying "You should learn a new technology." They are basically saying, the "things you have already learned aren't relevant." I honestly don't give a fuck for that kind of advice. It's completely senseless.</p><p class="" id="idMy-perspective-is--most-people-can-t-tel">My perspective is, most people can't tell the difference between helping someone and advising someone to help themselves. This is some sort of "teach a person to fish" passive-aggressive bullshit. This is just as toxic as "do as I say, not as I do." Because the next time someone asks for my help, I'm going to tell them what to do, instead of doing the thing they need, just to be an asshole. Because that's what I've been taught by all the so-called "thought leaders". I actually actively avoid people who tell me I need an attitude change, because they are the ones who need a perspective change on what it means to be a leader.</p></div>
