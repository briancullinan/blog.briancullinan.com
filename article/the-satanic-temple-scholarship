<div class="cell-0 val-content "><p class="A" id="idWhen-I-read-Satan-was-offering-devil-s-a">When I read Satan was <a href="https://thesatanictemple.com/pages/scholarship">offering devil’s advocate scholarships</a>, I realized I couldn’t resist. What a common thought “teachers who crushed your spirit” describes me perfectly. Most of us have probably had dozens of teachers, including parents, and friends, even co-workers. Therefore, if an essay about crushed spirits is a qualifier for a scholarship, wouldn’t Satan himself choose the most crushed spirit out of all submissions to enact his will? If this is the case, then the essay isn’t really about who crushed my spirit, but rather, how this experience makes me the most possible crushed spirit of any candidate.</p><p class="" id="id-Money-is-the-root-of-all-evil----Timoth">“Money is the root of all evil” - Timothy 6:10. It wasn’t long before I realized that if I toil to earn a living, other people must also be toiling for the same reasons. But just the nuance in the word “living” represents a certain level of privilege. Most people are just trying to survive. What is the difference between surviving and living? Surviving is struggling to meet basic physiological needs. Living means you have enough energy to not just survive, but to also take a step back and think about how much you enjoy your survival. Living means you have already got survival figured out, and you can take a break from surviving to appreciate the things you’ve earned and the world around you. I might go as far as to argue surviving is physiological, and living is philosophical.</p><p class="" id="idA-person-can-transition-from-a-surviving">A person can transition from a surviving mode to a living mode using money. Money can buy a person food security, housing, safety, isolation, and virtually limitless experience, both positive and negative. Money can even be used to buy things we don’t need like drugs and alcohol. Money can also be used to punish people, especially people that live and survive in ways people with money disagree with. Teachers and doctors are also subjected to the same evils the rest of us fight off in order to survive. Because money is directly tied to that means of survival, it can interfere with people’s ability to reason on problems that are not related to money.</p><p class="" id="idFor-example--a-musical-instrument-does-n">For example, a musical instrument does not care about money. It does not inherently care about being played either. But a school might make the decision to cut funding to a musical program. Why? This does not affect the instrument, anyone could come along and try to use it to play music. This might affect the student, if music was some sort of release of negative energy. Isn’t turning negative energy into positive music good for society? Money, in this example, is acting against what is good for society. Money is supposed to be a tool to serve us, and it falls short of that expectation.</p><p class="" id="idIt-should-be-no-surprise-that-the-teache">It should be no surprise that the teacher who shafted me the worst, and crushed my spirit, was motivated by money. I’ve written about it before as a sort of emotional healing. Sure, there were teachers along the way. In 6th grade I was scolded for swearing and goofing off with a classmate, and the teacher made me hold her hand to the cafeteria stating “if you’re going to act like a child I’m going to treat you like one.” Obviously, everybody is somebody’s child, so she wasn’t getting any points for logic with me. That was irritating, but certainly not soul crushing.</p><p class="" id="idIt-was-in-my-second-to-final-year-of-sch">It was in my second to final year of school when my partial tuition waiver was removed. I had been working for the school, rebuilding a radio station. We worked all year on it including over winter break, holidays, spring break. We also built the radio station a new online presence and updated their website, with calendar events and streaming the radio stations music online. By the end of the school year, the administrator for the School of Communications who told me I would be removed from the tuition program because my grades weren’t good enough. I was required to fill in a grade form every week, and when I asked my teachers, many of them responded “I don’t have an up-to-date record of your grades.” I was supposed to badger my teachers that decided to update grades only 4 times throughout the year, every single week.</p><p class="" id="idBecause-I-didn-t-see-the-point-in-badger">Because I didn’t see the point in badgering my teachers about my grades, I didn’t do the weekly paperwork. This is the reason the Director cut my tuition. This was soul crushing for a few reasons. I felt like I had worked very hard the entire year to create a better learning environment for other students, the radio station. I thought that something so trivial as a weekly grade report pales in comparison to the importance of financial aid. It seemed absurd to use a meaningless rule to ruin, what I thought was, a very meaningful relationship. But I also realized in this moment, that no matter how good or hard working a person is, there will always be some prick in power who is eager to tear you down.</p><p class="" id="idWithout-a-plan-for-tuition--I-dropped-ou">Without a plan for tuition, I dropped out of school. I applied for jobs in my field of Computer Science. Thankfully, I landed a job working for a medical device start-up and they didn’t interrogate my educational background. I was able to demonstrate enough skill to show I’d be a valuable addition to the team. The same skill and passion that the radio station at school just lost.</p><p class="" id="idThis-is-why-I-am-advocating-you-extend-t">This is why I am advocating you extend the scholarship program to all people that seek a formal education; not just high school graduates. If I take scholarship money away from The Satanic Temple, I am taking away the root of all their evil. I may finally return to Business School so I can learn how to help people with money instead of hurt them over it.</p><p class="" id="idP-S--I-m-sure-the-Devil-wouldn-t-mind-a-">P.S. I'm sure the Devil wouldn't mind a little white lie. I actually did graduate, I just don't want to have to pay for business school. It feels counter-intuitive. Like if the school was doing it's job properly, it could profit off a capstone project and not charge it's students at all because everyone would come out the other end qualified to start their own business.</p></div>
