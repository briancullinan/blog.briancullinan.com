<div class="cell-0 val-content "><p class="" id="id-With-great-power-comes-great-responsibi">“With great power comes great responsibility.” Uncle Ben said to Peter Parker as he went off to school. How does this apply to Apple versus EPIC Games. To me it is pretty obvious Apple is in the wrong. And they have been in the wrong for a long time.</p><p class="" id="idLet-s-take-a-brief-look-at-Apple-s-histo">Let’s take a brief look at Apple’s history with gaming. In the 90s Apple supported games. They also made games. In the early 2000s Apple realized if they wanted to be in the gaming market, they should slice off all game developers and create their own specialized game development team. They made design decisions to ruin gaming for Mac users. They tried to kill OpenGLs working standards board. They invented their own graphics language which hardly anyone cares about adopting. They fucked up on Macbook Pros keyboards, touch bars, their components like processor (CPU) and graphics (GPU) cards have been a whole decade behind other industry leaders who make laptops. Seriously, they put decades old hardware in their brand new computers. It’s like a practical joke, to pay $5,000 for a piece of old hardware. If you consider the market in general, I would say only about 1/5 of games are available for Mac, even if the hardware and software support it, gaming companies refuse to make it available on Mac.  If there was ever a reason in all of software history for hatred and failure to turn into criminal behavior, Apple has got all the motive it needs.</p><p class="A A" id="idAsk-any-person-in-my-field-of-computer-s">Ask any person in my field of computer science, anybody, will tell you Apple sucks for video games. Which is strange because some of those people use a Mac to make the games. It just can’t be used to enjoy the video games. Apple has acted like thugs as a company many, many, many times in the past. It is no wonder to me that they would turn that angst against a big publishing company. Don’t get me wrong, EPIC aren’t exactly angels either. They have a track record of abusive <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/report-fortnite-developers-recount-horrible-working-conditions-epic-games">employment policies, deadlines,</a> and working overtime. It’s so bad, their own well paid employees want to start the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/big-union-make-videogame-workers-lives-sane/">first ever software union</a> to battle unfair contracts and expectations of developers. Screwing smaller publishers out of opportunities. They use a crappy Exclusivity Agreement, which tells publishers they are only allowed to brand their games as sold by the EPIC store. People who publish with EPIC would be prohibited from also selling their game through Steam. EPIC has tried to rely less on Steam, and even tried to release their own game launcher, similar to Steam, but much worse.</p><p class="" id="idGrab-the-popcorn--everybody-">Grab the popcorn, everybody!</p><p class="A A" id="idThe-entire-purpose-of-jurisprudence-is-t">The entire purpose of jurisprudence is to protect the vulnerable and disempowered. What good is a court system if it isn’t used to protect people? Who then, in this battle, is the disempowered? It is hard to favor one side or the other when they both act like assholes. It’s like watching a chicken fight, it just makes you feel sorry, because there is nothing you can do to save either chicken, but you can’t hardly look away when one goes for the jugular. I say, thank you EPIC for finally poking this badger with a spoon. Apple needs to change its policies on publishing because they have hurt people, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/17-204_bq7d.pdf">time,</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-14/facebook-says-apple-s-in-app-fees-hurt-businesses-during-covid">time again</a>. I’ve built businesses for profit sharing, we never considered an 80-20 split. That’s just unfair, I want our partner companies to be successful because even a 50-50 split of a lot of business is better than an 80-20 split of very little business. I want our partners to put those profits back into building more business for both of us.</p><p class="" id="idSomething-tells-me-Apple-doesn-t-care-ab">Something tells me Apple doesn’t care about this sentiment. They deserve what is coming to them. Bring down the hammer on Apple. If you are going to act like a public service for the whole world, you will be regulated like one.</p></div>
