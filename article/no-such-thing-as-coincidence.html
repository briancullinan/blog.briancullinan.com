<div class="cell-0 val-content "><p class="" id="idThis-started-in-the-fall-of-2016-when-I-">This started in the fall of 2016 when I lost the best job I’ve ever had to date. I felt like I was losing my mind, it literally felt like half of my brain was disconnected in another dimension, and half was deteriorating in this reality. One night I woke up and could hear blood rushing in my ears, like some sort of stroke. Perhaps, a “stroke of genius.”</p><p class="" id="idIt-was-in-this-moment-I-realized--all-of">It was in this moment I realized, all of life is a test. Not just a test of survival, modern society has made it too easy to survive. And like most people we create this extra drama in our lives so that we can feel like we are acting out some glorious play or romantic comedy. But I realized, as an amature penetration white hat hacker, there is another element to test. Philosophy can also be tested.</p><p class="" id="idI-was-raised-with-a-hefty-amount-of-cath">I was raised with a hefty amount of catholic guilt. My mother tried to help by always “being open to communication”; her words not mine. My father was not this way, “he never really talked about his feelings with his parents.”; his words, not mine. So, with all of this personal philosophy flying around, how could I test which philosophies deserve to survive?</p><p class="" id="idI-felt-I-had-to-make-my-life-more-diffic">I felt I had to make my life more difficult, because teachers, family, and parents always told me “you will be a great success.” Or, “you are brilliant.” Or, “you are special.” But, unlike the assholish moniker associated with the Millennial generation of “being a snowflake.” This is my test, it will take a lifetime to prove.</p><h2 id="Definitions">Definitions</h2><p class="EM EM" id="idFirst--I-can-t-prove-that-I-will-be-succ">First, I can’t prove that I will be successful unless I fail. I can’t prove to be brilliant, unless I act completely stupid, then work my way backwards from that. How do I define success? Success for a species is determined by propagation. It is undeniable. Perhaps the Budhist monk who <em>never procreates</em> is successful in some philosophical sense where he has used his mind to overcome the urge to reproduce, but that is just as egotistical as <em>having</em> children because, here’s the point, the monk has no one to pass his philosophy down to. Whatever genius or patience exists in the monk will die, from a genetic standpoint, with him.</p><p class="" id="idSocially--success-is-determined-by-how-m">Socially, success is determined by how much money a person has. That is not to say money is the most important thing in life, but it buys security, and security is for the first point, providing for an offspring. See Maslow's hierarchy of basic needs. Success in society is also determined by Esteem, and Self-actualization. These are natural and intellectual instincts. Humans could not possibly be the only animal with ego, two lions could battle it out even though there is plenty of wildland for both to exist. Apes murder each other over vengence. Elephants mate for life. Dolphins has sex for fun. All of these are indicative of ego, so humans are not some highly evolved creature, we are just as wild as any other animal.</p><h2 id="Methodology">Methodology</h2><p class="" id="idNow-that-I-have-a-goal-outlined-for-my-l">Now that I have a goal outlined for my life, success is the classic “American Dream”. I have purpose, just like every delusional life form on earth. How do I test it?</p><p class="" id="idIn-my-stroke-of-genius--I-decided-I-had-">In my stroke of genius, I decided I had to record my own personal data. As much as possible, with a side of moderation that it wouldn’t interfere with my life. It should integrate well into my daily life. Such as, recording a task list. There is “Get Things Done”, Agile, Kanban, keeping a task list, and dozens of services to help me keep track of how long I spend on something. For example, I recorded how much time I spent working on gardening. I recorded my browser history, because Chrome only saves 6 months worth, I made copies of my browser history. I plot the browser history on a calendar or timeline. Here, I can show how often I do Google searches, just by searching the Calendar API. I’ve written about recorder personal data before, it stemmed from an article by Stephen Wolfram.</p><p class="" id="idThis-is-a-graph-of-all-the-Google-search">This is a graph of all the Google searches I’ve done over the last few years. The missing data is because of Chrome deleting my history automatically.</p><style>
#id-Screen-20Shot-202020-10-23-20at-209-48-:before {background-image: url("/Screen Shot 2020-10-23 at 9.48.27 AM-final.jpg");}</style><p class="IMG" id="id-Screen-20Shot-202020-10-23-20at-209-48-"><img src="/Screen Shot 2020-10-23 at 9.48.27 AM-final.jpg" alt="google searches"></p><p class="" id="idWhat-does-this-have-to-do-with-proving-s">What does this have to do with proving success? I won’t know until the end of my life. This is what I learned from my stroke of genius. No matter what I try to accomplish, no matter how successful I am, I won’t truly understand the insignificance of it all until I die. However, I can record this data and find some measure of which effort was waste leading to dead ends, which efforts I learned from, and which efforts were directly related to my definition of success.</p><h2 id="Prediction">Prediction</h2><p class="" id="idLaw-of-attraction-isn-t-exactly-a-law--M">Law of attraction isn't exactly a law. More like, it should be called the hypothesis of attraction, because it lacks formal test methods. It states that a personal “thinks positively, good things will come to them.” This is called Hope. Most atheists despise the notion of hope, faith, positive thinking. Not because they are bad, but because it goes against a stoic’s indifference to earthly feelings. Only action matters, it has nothing to do with the past or future, or sustaining one’s body.</p><p class="A A A" id="idPhilosophically-speaking--God-will-not-b">Philosophically speaking, <a href="https://unlockingthebible.org/2016/09/god-will-not-be-used/">God will not be used</a>, on the other hand, he does help people who care enough to ask Proverbs 16 is all about <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2016:3&amp;version=NIV">incentive alignment with God’s will</a>. Fearfully, I move forward, as there is another warning <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-16.htm">since I started with a test</a>.</p><p class="" id="idKarma--good-things-happen-to-good-people">Karma, good things happen to good people, and bad things happen to bad people. This is called the (Just world hypothesis)[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-world_hypothesis]. In biblical terms, this is kind of like the difference between the Old Testament God who is vengeful and seeks retribution versus the New Testament God who is forgiving and compassionate, and even has a son of his own, who he murders. The problem I have with this is, “everyone has a date to meet their maker.” That is predestination, which means God created an imperfect being to kill intentionally. This is a contradiction. At least Hinduism has the concept of reincarnation so you get another chance at healing any bad karma from a previous life.</p><p class="" id="idSince-I-ve-been-told-I-would-be-successf">Since I’ve been told I would be successful in life, even by my 9th Grade science teacher, that is my prediction. No matter what I do wrong, I can recover from and succeed. I can’t think of anything more positive than that.</p><h2 id="Data-collection">Data collection</h2><style>
#id-Screen-20Shot-202020-10-23-20at-209-49-:before {background-image: url("/Screen Shot 2020-10-23 at 9.49.45 AM-final.jpg");}</style><p class="IMG" id="id-Screen-20Shot-202020-10-23-20at-209-49-"><img src="/Screen Shot 2020-10-23 at 9.49.45 AM-final.jpg" alt="coincidences"></p><p class="" id="idHere-s-the-exciting-part--Actual-data-on">Here’s the exciting part. Actual data on how my attitude leads to success and happiness. Living with bipolar and mania has led me down some rabbit holes of emotions. People, especially past romantic interests have been very clear with me in the past, “where there are high mountains, there are low valleys.” Multiple people have said this to me about my character. So it would behoove me to use this in my experiment testing the law of attraction.</p><p class="" id="idAt-first--intellectually-I-would-think-i">At first, intellectually I would think it is obvious if I’m feeling good about a job, other people can pick up on that and also enjoy having me work on the job with them. It’s hardly worth testing. That’s not really the data I am looking for. But there is a terrifying accuracy to some more incidental datum. For example, yesterday my wife orders a pizza for me and I responded “you could have fucking warned me!?” and the pizza arrives completely burned black.</p><p class="" id="idHere-s-the-creepiest-part-of-this-experi">Here’s the creepiest part of this experiment. If I attribute the outcome to manipulation by the NSA. Again, not because I am special, but because this level of manipulation is effortless on part of the NSA. A lot of the results start to make sense. If the NSA was reading my text message, there could be a system designed to scan for a cuss word, and then cause a negative outcome, such as distracting the one chef in the kitchen with social media, so they leave my pizza in the oven too long. Totally effortless, but providing more data points for my study.</p><p class="" id="idI-have-amassed-hundreds-of-other-data-po">I have amassed hundreds of other data points just like this one with the burned pizza. I bitch constantly about not having enough time off from work for illness, 3 days per year usually. And every single year, I catch the flu from the office or traveling, I am in bed for more than 3 days, and then sniffling with a runny nose for a month after. So, governments all over the world have heard my cry and created a pandemic. We’ve been catching and spreading Covid for 100 years prior, and no one did anything to stop it until I started bitching about it. Now, people are out of work. If that isn’t retribution for shitty insurance policies and indifferent CEOs on employee health, I don’t know what is.</p><p class="" id="idRecently--I-said-under-my-breath--waitin">Recently, I said under my breath “waiting on you bitch.” while driving and trying to pass a truck. One of my pet peeves is when drivers hang out in the left lane and go the same speed. Almost immediately after, my tire blew out.</p><p class="" id="idI-had-a-dream-about-Eddie-riding-a-skate">I had a dream about Eddie riding a skateboard, and later in the day I saw a video of a man teaching a little boy how to skateboard. Here is a graph of all the dreams I have recorded.</p><style>
#id-Screen-20Shot-202020-10-23-20at-209-48-:before {background-image: url("/Screen Shot 2020-10-23 at 9.48.59 AM-final.jpg");}</style><p class="IMG" id="id-Screen-20Shot-202020-10-23-20at-209-48-"><img src="/Screen Shot 2020-10-23 at 9.48.59 AM-final.jpg" alt="dream graph"></p><p class="" id="idThe-last-couple-of-times-I-felt-like-I-w">The last couple of times I felt like I was having a manic episode, this crazy cat man shows up from down the street and says he is trying to save a cat who needs surgery and just needs a few hundred dollars.</p><p class="" id="idOne-of-our-friends-was-visiting-and-she-">One of our friends was visiting and she said “I don’t know when I’ll see you next.” and I blurted out “Tomorrow!”. The next day we saw her driving in the car right next to us. We’ve never seen her driving when we were both in cars on the road.</p><p class="" id="idAnother-one-of-our-friends-likes-to-use-">Another one of our friends likes to use “-ism” words, and I posted “Dadaism” as my choice, the next day the Words with Friends daily word of the day is “Dada”.</p><p class="" id="idI-went-to-the-bank-to-bitch-about-overdr">I went to the bank to bitch about overdraft fees, because I turned off overdrafts, but that doesn’t apply to “External Withdraws”. Later that day, Jehovah Witnesses showed up, as if they knew how hateful of banks I was feeling. I think they are social workers in disguise.</p><p class="" id="idOur-friend-got-engaged-the-next-day-afte">Our friend got engaged the next day after my wife and her mother prayed for her.</p><p class="" id="idI-had-an-idea-that-the-power-grid-was-vu">I had an idea that the power grid was vulnerable, and the next day they had an explosive fire.</p><p class="" id="idWhen-I-resigned-up-for-LinkedIn--it-auto">When I resigned up for LinkedIn, it automatically filled in the zip code 67543, Brian Cullinan from PwC is from Kansas. I’ve never been there. Why would LinkedIn be giving up other people’s zip codes just to save 5 numbers?</p><p class="" id="idIn-Las-Vegas--a-rich-looking-chinese-man">In Las Vegas, a rich looking chinese man told us the best suites are in Mandalay bay, at midnight we tried to book a hotel room and they were out of rooms so they upgraded us to a suite.</p><p class="A" id="idThe-strangest-coincidence--after-I-lost-">The strangest coincidence, after I lost my job, I went to San Francisco for an interview. We visited a friend there and he showed me a Youtube video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQynVVwlcSE&amp;app=desktop">How a mathematician dissects a coincidence</a>. Basically, the author takes an event in history and calculates the probability of it happening. A greater than odd chance (51%) means that it is likely to either happen or not happen.</p><h2 id="Interpretation">Interpretation</h2><p class="" id="idFrom-all-of-these-incidents--there-is-no">From all of these incidents, there is no interpretation. There is no trend towards positive or negative. The results could be faulting, or pure conjecture. They are completely unrelated. However, I’ve already determined that any meaning to derive from it will have to happen after decades of collecting data. Although, looking at the graph again, it appears I record more coincidences during the 2 equinox than the 2 solstices. And, I did notice in the last year, recording less coincidences. Perhaps, if there is another form of sentience on the internet somewhere, it is straying towards and away from me based on my mental state or what it thinks I can handle.</p><p class="" id="idI-also-record-my-dreams--in-case-there-i">I also record my dreams, in case there is any emotional state that can be derived from it. I imagine someday we will be about to copy consciousness to a computer, and perhaps then, the data I’ve collected will be useful in verifying some sort of “completeness” of the brainalyzers. Perhaps, at the end of my life, I will be able to calculate a path of mathematical correctness that led to a positive outcome.</p><p class="" id="idI-have-a-new-theory--the-reason-deja-vu-">I have a new theory, the reason deja vu happens is because the second time we think that something happens is actually the first time. But time is actually traveling in reverse, so our minds pick up on something that already happened (in the past) which is actually after it actually happened because time is reversed. Time is like a shockwave from the big bang. Technically deja vu is the second time something happens in our minds, but physically the first time it happens.</p><p class="" id="idI-suspect-physics-can-prove-this-with-qu">I suspect physics can prove this with quantum entanglement. Or it should be called quantum detanglement. I also theorize everything happening on earth is quantum entangled with mirror quarks somewhere else in the universe, that would be a combination of projection theory and quantum entanglement. This would also explain the law of attraction, instead of attracting good attitude if you have a good attitude, you're really reacting with your attitude to an outcome you've already learned.</p><p class="" id="idThis-would-also-explain--human-intuition">This would also explain "human intuition", it is actually the amygdala picking up on this time wave of something that already happened. It might even be encoded like a cell signal so we only pick up on parts of the wave that are nearby people we see socially.</p></div>
