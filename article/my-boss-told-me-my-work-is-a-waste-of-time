<div class="cell-0 val-content "><p class="STRONG" id="idMy-boss-told-me-all-of-my-work-was-a-was">My boss told me all of my work was a waste of time. I worked at Swiftpage, a bullshit marking company. The Head of HR is also partner of the company. Not exactly an employee advocate. That's where I learned that if there is a problem you need to address with HR, it turns out <strong>YOU</strong> are the problem. I decided to dismiss myself instead; I doubt they will ever admit to doing something wrong. I wonder if they have changed their policy about holding people's data hostage if they fail to pay their bill on time. I am pretty sure keeping people's data hostage is illegal according to GDPR (and now California's CPPA laws), and they have a satallite office in the UK. Why do I get stuck working for shitty companies? I feel like in order to be useful, I have to write about things that are useful to other people also.</p><h2 id="Oral-health-">Oral health:</h2><p class="" id="idMostly-everything-that-goes-into-your-st">Mostly everything that goes into your stomach, passes through your mouth first.  That means your mouth has the enzymes that are carried further into your digestive system.  Doesn't it stand to reason, that the health and state of these enzymes also affect your overall health?</p><h2 id="Angular-">Angular:</h2><p class="" id="idBefore-I-started-with-Angular--I-made-th">Before I started with Angular, I made the classic mistake of inventing my own framework.  I think at least everyone should go through the experience of developing sometime "too rigid", so they can appreciate the technology stacks we have now.</p><p class="" id="idI-began-by-using-angular-cli--and-that-m">I began by using angular-cli, and that make my life a lot easier than trying to configure webpack.  There is an emit option in angular-cli that makes it easy to revert to the classic mode of compiling with webpack.</p><h2 id="Node-">Node:</h2><p class="" id="idI-love-node--and-I-think-V8-is-one-of-th">I love node, and I think V8 is one of the coolest things to happen to the web.  The reason is simple, you can run the same code on the client as you do on the server.  This sounds like a simple statement, but I think it has made codebases a lot smaller.</p><h2 id="Docker-">Docker:</h2><p class="" id="idI-ve-used-Docker-every-day-for-the-past-">I've used Docker every day for the past two years.  One problem I run into sometimes is this //pipe/ error on Windows.  Reinstalling completely appears to help.</p><p class="" id="idMy-favorite-part-about-Docker-is-automat">My favorite part about Docker is automatically installing and configuring services.  A lot of software requires a fairly comprehensive knowledge of how it works in order to use it.</p><p class="" id="idI-think-this--anti-user-experience--thin">I think this "anti-user-experience" thinking.  Software should require very little knowledge in order to use it properly.  Therefore, it should "just work" when I download and install it.</p><p class="" id="idDocker-abstracts-the-complexities-of-dow">Docker abstracts the complexities of downloading, installing, configuring, and running.  Now to make use of something, I typically just search for "</p><platform><p class="" id="iddocker--where">docker" where</p><platform><p class="" id="idis-replaced-by-whatever-task-or-technolo">is replaced by whatever task or technology I am trying to accomplish.</p><h2 id="Firebase-">Firebase:</h2><p class="" id="idFirebase-is-awesome---What-I-love-about-">Firebase is awesome.  What I love about Firebase is the part where it removes the entire service layer.  It use to be, I have my front-end, my back-end, and various services in between to check for things like access control, permissions, aggregate data, etc.</p><p class="" id="idPretty-much-every-fields-saved-or-intera">Pretty much every fields saved or interaction needed it needs validation on the front-end, validation in the service, validation by the database.  Firebase gives me real-time data, with ACLs, directly from the server to the client.  No services or authorization in between to get what you need to display to the user.</p><h2 id="Education-in-the-workplace-">Education in the workplace:</h2><p class="" id="idI-feel-knowledgeable--but-no-one-around-">I feel knowledgeable, but no one around cares!  This pretty much encapsulates everything that is wrong with the workplace today.</p><p class="" id="idI-realized-a-while-ago--with-the-help-my">I realized a while ago, with the help my father who is in the manufacturing business;  I don't actually do anything.  I don't produce anything physical.  My labors can't be used or benefited from by other people.  If my Github repository disappears there's literally nothing left of my existence.</p><p class="" id="idOnce-I-realized-I-this--it-lead-me-to-re">Once I realized I this, it lead me to realize, if I am not producing any output, how can my performance possibly be measured with any sense of accuracy?  There is this idea in the corporate world that departments and costs and employees must be measured and evaluated.</p><p class="" id="idI-hate-employee-evaluations---The-whole-">I hate employee evaluations.  The whole idea sounds idiotic to me.  If an employee wasn't doing what they were asked to do, tell them when it happens, don't wait until the end of the year like a slap in the face.  I've never really had a bad review;  I gave a bad review to a company one time, and I received a 50% raise because of it.</p><p class="" id="idI-propose-a-new-metric---Count-the-numbe">I propose a new metric:  Count the number of skills you've learned in the last</p><time period=""><p class="" id="id--The-manager-that-imposed-this-stupid-e">. The manager that imposed this stupid employee evalutation on me works for GoDaddy now. This supports my theory that a bunch of assholes work for GoDaddy. Their CEO Bob Parsons shoots elephants. I shook his hand once after I snuck in to their Christmas party.</p><style>

He is a Christian and Ecclesiestes is very clear on the matter; Everything is a waste of time. Here he is again, chasing after the wind. Meaningless!</p></time></platform></platform></div>
