<li>It seems like whatever cool idea some Sci-Fi author came up with in the last 100 years, someone is going to try to invent it in the real world. This isn't always good since most good stories have conflict.</li>
<li>Technology repeats itself. Google AMP reminds me of Mozilla XUL. With AMP, the logical part of the code is abstracted away from the declarative part of the code in perfect order. This reminds me of MVVM from Microsoft Xaml with WPF and from those concepts came Observables. UIs can be cool and plain old HTML/CSS feels good again.</li>
<li>Prophecy is called such because we have to make it become true in the future, not because someone in the past had super natural powers and could tell the future. We get to pick and choose which predictions are true because someone already published the idea.</li>
<li>Advertising has reached obscene levels. It deserves it's own post.</li>
<li>As a company becomes more and more profit driven, it cares less and less about customers.</li>

<li>Notifications of any kind; except Life360 that tells me when my roommates arrive at key conjectures in life, like the best taco place in town. It's like a flight tracker for friends.</li>
<li>Advertising of any kind; it amazes me how dstracting radio Ads are even legal. Highway ads aside from what is available at an exit, I mean big billboards, should be illegal.</li>
<li>Bright screens; I try to use minimum brightness for visibility, otherwise it strains my eyes throughout the day. I use Night mode on Android.</li>
<li>The internet; it isn't safe, I tell you!</li>

<li>Game design; it turns out, I still have a passion for gaming.</li>
<li>Language design; I really like the concept of https://www.rascal-mpl.org/ and https://racket-lang.org/. I would like to add machine learning for sentence structure to derive the function from the documentation.</li>
<li>Functions for life; like Amazon order buttons, for things like toilet paper and dish soap. I've also thought it would be nice to add more smart-home components, like a ductless split HVAC system so each room could be climate controlled only when people are in them.</li>
<li>Making code look like the things it is representing. For example, an app for bartending should show some pictures of mixed drinks, in the code as well as in the app. This is one of the nice features of jupyter, my inputs, code, and output, can all be illustrated and stored in one file. When organized properly, beautiful demonstrations can be made alongside the API the created it.</li>
