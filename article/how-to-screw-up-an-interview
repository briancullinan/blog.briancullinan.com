<div class="cell-0 val-content "><p class="" id="idAhh--the-beautiful-city-of-San-Francisco">Ahh, the beautiful city of San Francisco. The most advanced city in the world has some of the weirdest problems. But that isn't what this article is about. It's about an interview I had.</p><p class="" id="idImagine-the-perfect-job-opportunity--com">Imagine the perfect job opportunity, coming at you out of the blue from cyberspace:</p><pre><code>Hi Brian,

My name is REDACTED, and I am CEO of REDACTED.
We are working on some really interesting problems in the behavioral finance space.
We just got a series B funding and are looking to expand our team.
Would you be open to having a short chat?
</code></pre><p class="" id="idWow--That-was-friendly--It-s-taken-me-a-">Wow! That was friendly. It's taken me a long time to appreciate the honesty in this introduction. It only took me a short time to screw it up.</p><pre><code>Hi REDACTED!

I'd love to have a chat about this,
especially since I've behaved badly financially,
and I'm attending a Dave Ramsey course.

I've attached my resume.
</code></pre><p class="" id="idI-just-started-learning-NodeJS-at-the-ti">I just started learning NodeJS at the time. The second technical interview, the guy walked me through various pieces of their platform, and I was able to spot and correct a bug on a stack I had never used before, including the adding the proper Unit Test for it.</p><h2 id="The-dream-city-of-San-Francisco">The dream city of San Francisco</h2><p class="" id="idI-invited-my-wife-to-go-with-me--Our-pla">I invited my wife to go with me. Our plan was to ditch the flight home and stay a few days after the interview. Of course we took a Cable Car around town. But that was after the interview.</p><style>
#id-yzs7bi1wzkb59m3xdj9x-jpg:before {background-image: url("/yzs7bi1wzkb59m3xdj9x-final.jpg");}</style><p class="IMG" id="id-yzs7bi1wzkb59m3xdj9x-jpg"><img src="/yzs7bi1wzkb59m3xdj9x-final.jpg" alt="sanfran trolly"></p><p class="" id="idWe-arrived-from-the-airport-and-I-had-sc">We arrived from the airport and I had scheduled a black town car to take us downtown. Their office was in the financial district.</p><p class="" id="idWhen-I-got-to-the-office--it-was-open-co">When I got to the office, it was open-concept. It was pretty quiet, but all the desks were in one room facing each other. A few offices on the side. We started the interview, it was about 10 AM but I had been traveling all morning, hadn't eaten, and already feeling like a clown wearing a tie when everyone else was in t-shirt and shorts.</p><p class="" id="idI-thought-I-was-being-cool-wearing-a-sui">I thought I was being cool wearing a suit and tie. I thought, I am ready to squash some bugs, like this guy:</p><style>
#id-ml04v5zjhdsc43cqbmy1-png:before {background-image: url("/ml04v5zjhdsc43cqbmy1-final.jpg");}</style><p class="IMG" id="id-ml04v5zjhdsc43cqbmy1-png"><img src="/ml04v5zjhdsc43cqbmy1-final.jpg" alt="hitman"></p><p class="" id="idI-tried-to-connect-to-the-internet--I-la">I tried to connect to the internet. I later realized that it wasn't their WiFi blocking me, it was because I had custom DNS settings, set to Google's public DNS. The interviewer let me use his phone's connection. Why should I spend my data in the interview? It's their office. The phone kept shutting off, and my internet died.</p><p class="" id="idNeedless-to-say--using-a-platform-I-was-">Needless to say, using a platform I was completely new to, without internet. I beefed the interview. That means I didn't do well. And my failures were on display to the entire company contained in their single office.</p><p class="" id="idI-was-invited-in-to-the-adjacent-office-">I was invited in to the adjacent office for the second part of the interview. It was about marketing and Airbnb. Or so I thought. They showed me a page where Airbnb's video failed to load. I suggested the fix was to use an automated test for every device. I should have just plugged the tablet in to my computer and looked at which transcoding the video used, tried to stream it myself, and then use AWS Elastic Transcoder (cloud VLC server?) to convert the video and play it on the iPad. Problem solved.</p><p class="" id="idSomething-tells-me-that-wasn-t-the-point">Something tells me that wasn't the point of the interview.</p><p class="" id="idWe-eventually-sat-down-for-lunch--It-was">We eventually sat down for lunch. It was salad. I can't say I was overjoyed. But I did appreciate the company fulfilling my physiological needs in exchange for work. If this was a regular thing, daily for this company, I could definitely make myself happy here.</p><p class="CODE" id="idThis-is-when-things-got-weird--I-started">This is when things got weird. I started asking some of the other employees what their <code>function()</code> is. One employee explained he works in iOS. Which I thought was strange, because my soon to be passive-aggressive middle manager just told me "everyone here is full stack." Wishful thinking I guess.</p><pre><code>"Everything is a waste of time."
</code></pre><p class="" id="idIf-I-ever-have-an-interview-again--don-t">If I ever have an interview again; don't say this people. It didn't turn out well.  In fact, it makes me look insane. Let's take a look inside Brian's brain!</p><style>
#id-uzjyd4a5yeqytp0096ua-png:before {background-image: url("/uzjyd4a5yeqytp0096ua-final.jpg");}</style><p class="IMG" id="id-uzjyd4a5yeqytp0096ua-png"><img src="/uzjyd4a5yeqytp0096ua-final.jpg" alt="gears of time"></p><p class="" id="idMoment-later--the-CEO-of-the-company-inv">Moment later, the CEO of the company invited me in to the side office. He asked how my other interviews are going. He told me "we don't really have the funds to 'raise' you. We can't afford to make any mistakes." Then he asked me to leave.</p><p class="" id="idI-never-really-recovered-from-that-exper">I never really recovered from that experience. I thought, this is the same feeling I had in high school when I was being bullied. It's the same feeling I had at the previous company before I was laid off. It's the same feeling I had at the company before that when I was accused of saying things I never said.</p><p class="" id="idIt-s-the-feeling-of-not-being-good-enoug">It's the feeling of not being good enough for something, and being judged for it. Maybe it's the feeling of shame.</p><h2 id="Well--jokes-on-them-">Well, jokes on them.</h2><p class="" id="idBecause-the-statement-of--everything-is-">Because the statement of "everything is a waste of time" is the core foundation of mine and many philosophies that have existed thousands of years longer than this tech company. It is in my core as a process improver. In the old testament, we have Ecclesiastes:</p><pre><code>"Meaningless! Meaningless!"
    says the Teacher.
"Utterly meaningless!
    Everything is meaningless."
</code></pre><p class="" id="idIn-TAO--we-have-the-concept-of-non-chang">In TAO, we have the concept of non-change and non-action. Where everything that exists must have a period of non-existence. Everything that is built can and probably will be destroyed.</p><p class="" id="idIn-Hinduism--I-particularly-like-the-int">In Hinduism, I particularly like the introduction to the Saṁyutta Nikāya:</p><pre><code>"I crossed over the flood without pushing forward, without staying in place."
</code></pre><p class="" id="idPretty-much-describes-my-life-as-a-progr">Pretty much describes my life as a programmer perfectly.</p><p class="" id="idIn-technology--we-see--life-cycles--all-">In technology, we see "life-cycles" all the time. Old technology is replaced for new technology and there is very little concern as to where the old technology ends up. I have a dozen broken phones in a bucket in my garage. The CEOs of the companies that manufactured them don't care.</p><p class="" id="idProcess-improvement-is-simple--Do-a-litt">Process improvement is simple. Do a little brainstorming! Make a list of 10 things you like most about your job. Then make a list of 10 things that you find are bothersome, annoying, take too much time, not fun. Then, and here's the kicker; stop doing those 10 things you don't like. Some people stop doing them, and hire interns to do them instead. If you are the intern, your job will make you miserable and you aren't going to feel fulfilled. When that happens, the quality of work becomes so low, it's not really worth it for the company to pay you to do it. Or you are giving up your health, which isn't worth it for the company, or their insurance policy. If you stop doing those 10 you don't like, the company will probably keep chugging along.</p><h2 id="Closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h2><style>

I love to be proven wrong. I love to wonder about my own significance and insignificance. Maybe, I have too much time to think on my hands. What would ever come of a Co-founder of a blog liking my article? ;)</p><p class="" id="idI-might-never-find-answers-to-these-ques">I might never find answers to these questions I have. But I am glad I have the capacity to pontificate them. And I am thankful I have a place to write them down. I am reading the book Fluke. But I can't help but wonder, in a world with seemingly impossibly complex systems, is there even a curtain to look behind?</p><p class="A" id="idFluke--The-Math-of-Coincidence"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fluke-Math-Coincidence-Joseph-Mazur/dp/0465060951">Fluke: The Math of Coincidence</a></p></div>
