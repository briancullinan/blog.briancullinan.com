I began programming when I was only 10 years old. One day I came home from school and found my dad working through a learning exercise in a VB 4 book. I got interested in the code, and how it could control things on screen. I dove in myself, with his help, by writing a Pokedex app. It was from the game/tv show Pokemon, it is an index of all the characters with descriptions and pictures. Soon after that, I became engrossed in the Windows API. I enjoyed how I could program an Enumeration tool that would list every window and application. I could hack and control other programs with my own code.

I wrote a Flash Card app for studying vocabulary definitions in 2000. I also wrote an app that changes the Windows desktop background based on the weather and time of day. When .Net came out, it automatically converted my project code and I didn't save a backup. I was devestated, the project was in ruins and I had no idea what I was doing. Around this time, I got in to web programming. I had multiple geocities accounts all linking and connected to each other to get around the data limitations. I liked to collect graphics and jokes, and play around with different styles. I wrote a website for Marching Band, so parents and fellow students could share and download pictures from the performance.

I wrote an app in Excel to help a favorite teacher with a cheerleading competition. Boy was I lucky then!  I worked for the high scool. My last year of high school, my school didn't offer a programming class, so I took a C++ class and Linux class at the community college. I was amazed and happy to be learning such fun technology. I learned how to dual boot machines, and run an apache web server. Now I was unstoppable, I didn't need a host for my websites or ideas, I could use my own computer connected to the internet, and other people could connect too!

In college, I studies Computer Science. I learned a lot of things I still use to this day, and a lot of things I never used again. Some of the most interesting classes I took were completely transformative. I took a Religions of the World class, when I realized all personal philosiphies are taught and come from somewhere else. The foundation of all religions is the same, to help people lead a fullfilling life through serving one-another. The class User Interfaces was an advance class. We learned principles to create a good/usable design. We would record a test subject, that was selected from outside the computer science program, then watch the video and figure out where they get hung up. The time it takes a person to figure out how to complete a task, is an indication of how well designed the interface is. I worked at the help desk my entire time in college. I worked for the radio station, and help rebuild the entire platform, my job there was cut short.

<div class="cell-0  "><p class="" id="idWhen-I-graduated-from-college--I-worked-">When I graduated from college, I worked for startups. I decided if I was going to burn myself out, I had to do it as early as possible. I worked 12+ hour days, 7 days per week for nearly 10 years. My first startup was a PCI-DSS compliance app, we harnessed hacking techniques to test people's websites for security vulnerabilities as a service to them. We made significant progress and was even awarded a spot on Google's list of Security Hall of Fame. I worked for a startup medical device company. The machine I helped the founder develop, could diagnose a person's organ health using a Kirlian image of their fingertip. Unfortuately, the technology was lost in time and propriety. I worked for an educational startup, we built 3 apps together for students, to help them learn techniques for studying. Our first app was a study plan, we could show students how to set up a schedule for studying. The second app we expanded on this idea and created an entire 15 step course for students. The third app was a lot like DuoLingo, it showed flash cards and used spaced repetition to help students memorize content. This was the first time I burned myself out, I built a system that was too rigid, and learned the meaning of "imposter syndrome".</p></div>
